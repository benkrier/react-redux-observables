## Purpose

This is a project started with create-react-app. In addition, it uses redux, redux-observables, react-router, and styled-components. The purpose of the build is to practice using Observables to stream data from a variety of APIs. I understand it's over-engineered. I'm building it partly for education and partly for fun.

### Github Search

Trying to have a search input that shows a dropdown of possible matches. Upon selection, the component will display the user avatar as well as a list of their public repos.
